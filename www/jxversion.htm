<h1>Version</h1>

The current version of the package is V0.3.3.

<h2>How are the versions counted?</h2>

The goal of the development is version V1.0. V1.0 means the whole thing is 
feature-complete, tested, documented. Additionally some people should have agreed
that the design is useful.

Meanwhile, the version number will increase in the first decimal whenever a 
significant change in one of the interfaces occured or a new features is added.
For minor changes like bugfixes, non-code-breaking enhancements or additional 
documentation, the second decimal will be counted.
<p>
A new version will be released as soon as it is implemented. That means that 
versions like 0.X.0 may lack of samples or documentation.
<p>
